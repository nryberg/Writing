Friday comes and goes - the wind blows regardless of this small person's point of view.

A brief coffee with the love of my life, shatter the illusions of work and dedicated analytics.  Let those tattered real nothing tissues fall to the ground with any other attachments and focus on what's truly important.

Truth be told, I've never like coffee all that much.  I'm just in it for the kicks.

At a certain point, everything around me becomes more important than this screen.  What little sense being made in fake letters and ink fades into nothingness along with my desires for attention, and I will sit quietly hoping that the next digital bus will come along soon.  I highly doubt that anyone has been updating the schedule and it's quite likely that I'll be sitting here for a while.

The rectaungular shapes of these Starbucks' windos is never quite right.  It's all a matter of perpctive isn't it.  The only one to see the perfect square is the architect and draftsmen who assemble the tiny bits and pieces of confetti into a whole.  

A night with Queen is an amazing thing for such tender minds.  Where I saw a profound sense of beauty in some rock start way, they saw hairstyles that faded long before their birth dates.
