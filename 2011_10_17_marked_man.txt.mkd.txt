# Marked Man for Life

Recently heard about Brett Terpstra's [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) app on the [Power Text Editing Mac Power Users podcast](http://5by5.tv/mpu/57-mpu-057).  Couldn't resist tempation, downloaded and now I'm loving it. 

Don't walk, run to your local Apps store and buy.

Combine this with [MacVim plugin for Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown) and you're off to the races.
