About to head to the last MN AE meeting.

I'll be leading a discussion of where the group will be going in 2013, and thankfully, I won't be there to see it.

I have accept the fact that it's time to move on.  

Now - what can we talk about?

* Tools (ACL, Tableau)
* Techniques (Fraud Detection, IT Audits)
** Managing the analytic workflow
* Roundtables
* Lightning Talks
